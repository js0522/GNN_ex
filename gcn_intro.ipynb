    "If we look around us, what we observe is that most of the real-world datasets come in the form of graphs or networks: social networks, protein-interaction networks, the World Wide Web, etc. As the name suggests, Graph Convolution Networks (GCN), draw on the idea of Convolution Neural Networks re-defining them for the graph domain.\n",
    "As we know a regular convolutional neural network captures the surrounding information of each pixel of an image.\n",
    "As for images, the convolution framework aims to capture neighbourhood information for graph nodes also.\n",
    "\n",
    "GCNs come in two varieties: Spectral GCNs and Spatial GCNs.Spectral-based approaches define graph convolutions by introducing filters from the perspective of graph signal processing which is based on graph spectral theory. Spatial-based approaches formulate graph convolutions as aggregating feature information from neighbours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectral approach has the limitation of the graph structure being same for all samples i.e. homogeneous structure. But it is a hard constraint, as most of the real-world graph data has different structures and size for different samples i.e. heterogeneous structure. On the other hand we have spatial approach which does not require homogeneous graph structure."
